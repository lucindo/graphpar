# graphpar - graph partitioning

Code from my master's thesis _"Algorithms for Balanced Connected Partitions of Graphs"_:

> In this dissertation we study algorithmic aspects of the following problem, known as the balanced connected partition. Given a connected graph G with weights defined on its vertices, and an integer q >= 2, find a partition of the vertices of G into q classes such that each class induces a connected graph, and furthermore, when we consider the sum of the weights of the vertices in each class, the smallest sum is as large as possible.
